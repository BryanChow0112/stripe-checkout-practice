# Stripe Checkout Practice

This repository documents **my learning experience with Stripe Checkout, a powerful tool for simplifying online payments.** I built this project to really understand how Stripe Checkout works and how to integrate it into a Node.js application. It's a hands-on way to explore the core backend pieces of payment processing, like creating checkout sessions, handling products and prices, managing payment flow and securely receiving payment confirmations.
